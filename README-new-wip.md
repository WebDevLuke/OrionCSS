	<p>A simple SASS-based OOCSS framework</p>
</p>

# What is OrionCSS?
OrionCSS is a SASS framework which is simple, easy to use and scalable. It provides you with a solid OOCSS base from which to build your project.

- **ITCSS Powered** - OrionCSS uses the popular OOCSS methodology [ITCSS](https://www.xfive.co/blog/itcss-scalable-maintainable-css-architecture) to organise its SASS and includes many useful object and utility classes out of the box. 
- **Easily Configurable Grid System** - Enter the max width, number of columns, gutter and padding of a grid system of your choice and SASS will automatically generate all the CSS classes and media query mixins for you.
- **Easily Manage Breakpoints** - Manage your media query breakpoints in one file which then automatically filters into the rest of the framework.
- **Usuable with Orion Framework** - Use as a dependency of the [Orion Framework](https://github.com/WebDevLuke/Orion-Framework) to access specifically built Gulp tasks to compile and optimise your SASS.
