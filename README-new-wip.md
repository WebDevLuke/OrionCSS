OrionCSS is a SASS framework which is simple, easy to use and scalable. It provides you with a solid OOCSS foundation on which to build your project.

- **ITCSS Powered** - OrionCSS uses the popular OOCSS methodology [ITCSS](https://www.xfive.co/blog/itcss-scalable-maintainable-css-architecture) to organise its SASS and includes many useful object and utility classes out of the box. 
- **Easily Configurable Grid System** - Enter the max width, number of columns, gutter and padding of a grid system of your choice and SASS will automatically generate all the CSS classes and media query mixins for you.
- **Easily Manage Breakpoints** - Manage your media query breakpoints in one file which then automatically filters into the rest of the framework.
- **Usuable with Orion Framework** - Use as a dependency of the [Orion Framework](https://github.com/WebDevLuke/Orion-Framework) to access specifically built Gulp tasks to compile and optimise your SASS. [(More Info)](#using-with-orion-framework)

## Getting Started

### Installation
The best way to use OrionCSS is as part of the larger [Orion Framework](https://github.com/WebDevLuke/Orion-Framework). [(More Info)](#using-with-orion-framework)

You can also use OrionCSS on it's own as a part of your own framework. To install it as a depedency using NPM, run the following command:

```
npm install orioncss --save
```

Next, you need to create the following directory structure in your project `sass` directory. This is where all your project's [ITCSS](https://www.xfive.co/blog/itcss-scalable-maintainable-css-architecture) layer files will sit.

- `/01 - settings` - Used with preprocessors and contain font, colors definitions, etc.
- `/02 - tools` - Globally used mixins and functions. Itâ€™s important not to output any CSS in the first 2 layers.
- `/03 - generic` - Reset and/or normalize styles, box-sizing definition, etc. This is the first layer which generates actual CSS.
- `/04 - elements` - Styling for bare HTML elements. These come with default styling from the browser so we can redefine them here.
- `/05 - objects` - Class-based selectors which define undecorated design patterns, for example media object known from OOCSS.
- `/06 - components` - Specific UI components. This is where majority of our work takes place and our UI components are often composed of Objects and Components.
- `/07 - utilities` - Helper classes which should primarily be used for positional and minor cosmetic styling (eg bold, no-wrap, text-alignments etc).

Now you've set up your directories, copy `/node_modules/orioncss/sample.main.scss` into your `sass` directory and rename it `main.scss`. This is where everything is imported and is the place which tells your favourite SASS build tool what to include in the compiled `main.css` stylesheet.

As you work on your project, you will want to add any new scss partials you create to `main.scss` as otherwise they won't be imported. Typically, a more developed `main.scss` may resemble the following:

```
// Objects
@import "../../node_modules/orioncss/05 - objects/objects.box";
@import "../../node_modules/orioncss/05 - objects/objects.cover";
@import "../../node_modules/orioncss/05 - objects/objects.expander";
@import "../../node_modules/orioncss/05 - objects/objects.grid-system";
@import "../../node_modules/orioncss/05 - objects/objects.list-bare";
@import "../../node_modules/orioncss/05 - objects/objects.list-inline";
@import "../../node_modules/orioncss/05 - objects/objects.media-flag";
@import "../../node_modules/orioncss/05 - objects/objects.media";
@import "../../node_modules/orioncss/05 - objects/objects.pack";
@import "../../node_modules/orioncss/05 - objects/objects.table";
@import "/05 - objects/objects.strip";

// Components
@import "/06 - components/components.buttons";
@import "/06 - components/components.icons";
@import "/06 - components/components.type";
```
You may need to edit the paths to `node_modules` to resemble your own project directory structure.

To give you a useful starting point for building your own components, a sample component can be found at `/node_modules/orioncss/06 - components/_sample.component.mycomponent.scss`.


## Using OrionCSS

### Class Namespaces

OrionCSS uses appropriate class namespaces to link them with their parent ITCSS layer. These are:

- `.o-`: Objects
- `.c-`: Components
- `.u-`: Utilities

It would be a good idea to follow this convention in your own code. Not only for consistency, but [because it's a good idea](https://csswizardry.com/2015/03/more-transparent-ui-code-with-namespaces/).

### Breakpoints
To define the framework breakpoints copy `/node_modules/orioncss/01 - settings/_settings.breakpoints.scss` into your own `sass/01 - settings/` directory and edit the config object.

```sh
{
  "sm": "370px",
  "sm2": "425px",
  "sm3": "500px",
  "md": "768px",
  "md2": "840px",
  "md3": "925px",
  "lg": "1024px",
  "lg2": "1280px",
  "lg3": "1440px"
}
```
These breakpoints can be used independantly using OrionCSS's [media query mixins] or as part of auto-generated classes for the many object and utility classes included with OrionCSS, including the grid system documented next.


### Grid System

#### Configuration
OrionCSS allows you to define a grid system of your choice. On compile SASS then generates all the required CSS classes and media query mixins automatically. 

Copy `/node_modules/orioncss/01 - settings/_settings.grid-system.scss` into your own `sass/01 - settings/` directory to get started.

```sh
$grid: (
  "default": (
    "max-width": 1170px,
    "columns": 12,
    "gutter": 30px,
    "containerPadding": 30px
  )
);
```

Here you set the variables which will create your grid system. By default this is set to a **1170px 12 column grid system**.

You can also reshape the grid at any of your defined breakpoints by creating entries within the `morph` property.

```sh
$grid: (
  "default": (
    "max-width": 1170px,
    "columns": 12,
    "gutter": 30px,
    "containerPadding": 30px
  ),
  'morph': (
    "lg" : (
      "max-width": 1600px,
      "columns": 16
    )
  )
);
```

The above example defines a **1170px 12 column grid system** which morphs into a **1600px 16 column grid system** once the `lg` breakpoint defined in `/01 - settings/_settings.breakpoints.scss` has been hit.

#### Usage

On compile SASS auto generates all the required classes you will need to construct grids to your specification as per `/01 - settings/_settings.breakpoints.scss`. Below are a few practical examples using the grid outlined in [Configuration](#configuration). If you've used bootstrap, the syntax here is almost identical.

##### Basic grid

```sh
<div class="o-container">
  <div class="o-row">
    <div class="o-col-4"></div>
    <div class="o-col-4"></div>
    <div class="o-col-4"></div>
  </div>
</div>
```
This is a basic 4/4/4 grid which doesn't change.

##### Basic grid w. breakpoint classes

```sh
<div class="o-container">
  <div class="o-row">
    <div class="o-col-4 o-col-1@md"></div>
    <div class="o-col-4 o-col-5@md"></div>
    <div class="o-col-4 o-col-6@md"></div>
  </div>
</div>
```
Here we introduce breakpoint classes which have been automatically created by SASS using the data entered in `/01 - settings/_settings.breakpoints.scss`. As this is a mobile-first framework, we start off with a basic 4/4/4 grid and as we scale up and hit the med breakpoint at 640px it will change to 1/5/6.

##### Advanced grid w. breakpoint classes

```sh
<div class="o-container">
  <div class="o-row">
    <div class="o-col-4@sm o-col-12@md o-col-4@lg o-col-6@lg"></div>
    <div class="u-col-offset-4@sm o-col-4@sm o-col-6@md u-col-offset-4@lg o-col-4@lg o-col-6@lg"></div>
    <div class="u-hide@sm u-display-block@md o-col-6@md u-col-offset-8@lg o-col-4@lg o-col-16@lg"></div>
  </div>
</div>
```
Here is an advanced example of how we can combine breakpoint classes to significantly alter our columns as we increase our browser resolution.

## Using with Orion Framework
When you use OrionCSS as part of the larger [Orion Framework](https://github.com/WebDevLuke/Orion-Framework), you access specifically built Gulp tasks to compile and optimise your SASS. These include:

- A setup task which creates all the directories and files you need to get you up and running as quickly as possible.
- `Build` and `Watch` tasks to easily compile your SASS.
- [gulp-sass-glob](https://github.com/mikevercoelen/gulp-sass-glob) is used to automatically import any new partials, so won't need to edit `main.scss` at all.
- [UNCSS](https://github.com/giakki/uncss) is used to remove any unused CSS classes from your stylesheet, so you don't have to worry about bloated CSS.
- [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) is automatically applied where applicable.

Please refer to [Orion Framework](https://github.com/WebDevLuke/Orion-Framework)'s github repository for more information.
